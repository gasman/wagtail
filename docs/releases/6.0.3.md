## Upgrade considerations

### Changes to UUID fields on MariaDB when upgrading to Django 5.0

Django 5.0 introduces support for MariaDB's native UUID type on MariaDB 10.7 and above. This breaks backwards compatibility with `CHAR`-based UUIDs created on earlier versions of Django and MariaDB, and so upgrading a site to Django 5.0+ and MariaDB 10.7+ is liable to result in errors such as `Data too long for column 'translation_key' at row 1` or `Data too long for column 'uuid' at row 1` when creating or editing pages. To fix this, it is necessary to run the [`convert_mariadb_uuids`](convert_mariadb_uuids) management command (available as of Wagtail 6.0.3) after upgrading:

```sh
./manage.py convert_mariadb_uuids
```

This will convert all existing UUID fields used by Wagtail to the new format. New sites created under Django 5.0+ and MariaDB 10.7+ are unaffected.
