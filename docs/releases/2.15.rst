Upgrade considerations
======================

Admin homepage panels and summary items now use components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _template_components_2_15:

Admin homepage panels (as registered with the :ref:`construct_homepage_panels` hook) and summary items (as registered with :ref:`construct_homepage_summary_items`) have been updated to adopt the :doc:`template components </extending/template_components>` pattern. User code that creates these object should be updated to ensure that they follow the component API. This will typically require the following changes:

 * Classes defined for use as homepage panels should be made subclasses of ``wagtail.admin.components.Component``, and the ``render(self)`` method should be changed to ``render_html(self, parent_context)``. (Alternatively, rather than defining ``render_html``, it may be more convenient to reimplement it with a template, as per :ref:`creating_template_components`.)
 * Summary item classes can continue to inherit from ``wagtail.admin.site_summary.SummaryItem`` (which is now a subclass of ``Component``) as before, but:

   * Any ``template`` attribute should be changed to ``template_name``;
   * Any place where the ``render(self)`` method is overridden should be changed to ``render_html(self, parent_context)``;
   * Any place where the ``get_context(self)`` method is overridden should be changed to ``get_context_data(self, parent_context)``.
